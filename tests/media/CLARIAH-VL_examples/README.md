# CLARIAH-VL Examples
As described in the OCCAM meeting minutes from July 2nd, 2020:
> Sally Chambers has created a list of data sets: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tsZVlY3Z00yzOhUXBkFsSyt3my_EThJLhKYuI327uvo/edit?usp=sharing. 
> For each of these six data sets, contact persons have been added. It should be discussed how the data from these sources can be shared as most of these are not available as an API. The partners have to decide which of these is potentially the most interesting and should therefore be prioritized. For the collection of further data sets, the time period, language, potential OCR quality,… can be taken into account to see what suits the project’s purposes best. Samples of these test sets can be sent to the partners in order to get an idea of the content. One of the sources is Europeana, which, as it falls under CEF, might be a politically and strategically important data set to include.
